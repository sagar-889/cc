## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### The Problem
- Gemini API was unreachable due to network restrictions
- System couldn't function without API access
- Features were broken locally

### The Solution
1. **Forced Local Mode** - System now runs locally by default during development
2. **Enhanced Fallbacks** - Intelligent context-aware fallback mechanisms
3. **Smart Analysis** - Uses user data to create personalized plans without AI API
4. **Robust Error Handling** - Graceful handling of all API failures

### Key Changes Made
- **File**: `backend/utils/trueAgenticAI.js`
  - Lines 29-57: Force local mode for development
  - Lines 165-197: Enhanced goal analysis with intelligent fallback
  - Lines 468-510: Local test generation
  - Lines 542-573: Career advice without API
  - Lines 587-637: Context-aware analysis algorithm

## 🔐 How Local Mode Works

### Without AI API
The system uses intelligent algorithms:
- Analyzes keywords in your goal
- Checks your enrolled courses
- Reviews your workload
- Considers upcoming deadlines
- Creates personalized plans
- Finds resources from database

### Context-Aware Intelligence
```javascript
Your Profile:
├── Department: Computer Science
├── Year: 2
├── Courses: 5 enrolled
├── Workload: 3 pending assignments
└── Schedule: 2 upcoming deadlines

Local Analysis:
├── Adjusts difficulty based on keywords
├── Estimates hours from workload
├── Schedules around deadlines
├── Recommends based on courses
└── Personalizes to your profile
```
